    Hi, I am a Front-end developer based in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany with experience in
    building web applications using JavaScript & Angular. I have been interested
    in web development since my school days.

      Last year, I decided to put this interest into practice in a professional
      training program. There I was able to gain experience in many practical
      projects and was regularly supported by trainers to develop good and clean
      code.

      I'm excited about building on my experience and starting my career in IT
      as a junior developer.
